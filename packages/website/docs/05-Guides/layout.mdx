# Layout

Layout components enable the creation of composable layouts. The main guiding principle is that
space between elements "belongs" to their container. In other words, components never define any
space outside their own boundaries. This allows for precise control of the spacing and makes
components truly re-usable in different spacing contexts.

The design system provides a set of layout components, that can be arbitrarily nested inside each
other to create complex layouts:

- Stack
- Inline
- Columns
- Inset
- ContentBlock

üôè The design of Layout components is heavily inspired by the
[Braid Design System](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/foundations/layout/) and the
[Rainbow Design System](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbow/tree/develop/src/design-system)
:::

## Spacing

The design system defines a standard spacing scale which applies across all components. Valid values
are:

<SpacingScale />

## Stack

`Stack` is a layout component that arranges its children vertically.

<Canvas path="Layout/StackBasic" />

You can control the vertical space between children with the `space` prop, which accepts finite set of values
as defined by the spacing scale.

`Stack` can also control the horizontal alignment of its children with the `align` prop:

<Canvas path="Layout/StackAlign" />

The `space` and the `align` props also supports defining their values depending on the breakpoint.
For example, you can define different `align` values on desktop and on mobile:

<Canvas path="Layout/StackAlignResponsive" />

:::tip
Try resizing the browser window to see how the alignment changes.
:::

:::info
If you specify only some breakpoints, e.g. `mobile` and `desktop`, they will "inherit" from the breakpoint immediately "above". For example, if you specify `mobile` and `desktop`, the `tablet` breakpoint will inherit from the `desktop` value.

`Stack` can also optionally render horizontal dividers in between its children using the `dividers`
prop:

<Canvas path="Layout/StackDividers" />

## Inline

`Inline` can be used to create horizontally flowing layouts, which wrap across multiple lines if
necessary.

<Canvas path="Layout/InlineBasic" />

The spacing between children can be controlled with the `space` prop, which is also applied between
rows.

`Inline` can control the horizontal and vertical alignment of its children with the `align` and
`alignY` props respectively.

<Canvas path="Layout/InlineAlign" />

Similarly to `Stack`, `space`, `align` and `alignY` can be defined depending on the breakpoint:

<Canvas path="Layout/InlineAlignResponsive" />

:::tip
Try resizing the browser window to see how the alignment changes.
:::

`Inline` can also automatically collapse its children into a single column when the screen is below
a certain breakpoint. This is achieved using the `collapseBelow` property.

Here's an example of a layout where the children are collapsed and centered only on mobile:

<Canvas path="Layout/InlineCollapseBelow" />

`Inline` can also render its children in reverse dom order: this may be useful in case you want to
preserve the DOM order for accessibility (e.g. tabbing using a keyboard respects DOM order) but
reverse the elements visually. For this you can use the `reverse` prop:

<Canvas path="Layout/InlineReverse" />

The `reverse` prop is also responsive, so you can apply the reverse visual ordering only for certain
breakpoints, if needed.

## Columns

`Columns` is used to create horizontal layouts with a larger degree of flexibility with respect to
`Inline`.

<Canvas path="Layout/ColumnsTwoColumn" />

Columns share the space evenly by default, but it's possible to control the width of individual
columns by using the `Column` component.

For example, here's a three-column layout where the two side columns occupy 1/5 of the available
space each and the central column takes up the remaining space:

<Canvas path="Layout/ColumnsThreeColumn" />

:::tip
Using `Column` without any props is equivalent to just passing its children directly.
:::

Columns can also be sized according to their content, which is useful when you want a column to be
as small as possible:

<Canvas path="Layout/ColumnsContentSizedColumn" />

Similarly to `Inline`, `Columns` can also control the horizontal and vertical alignment of columns:

<Canvas path="Layout/ColumnsAlignY" />

And again, `space`, `align` and `alignY` can be defined depending on the breakpoint and
`collapseBelow` can be used to arrange columns vertically below a certain screen size:

<Canvas path="Layout/ColumnsCollapseBelow" />

`Columns` supports the same `reverse` property as `Inline`. This is particularly usefor for
implementing layouts where you have columns that you want to collapse in reverse DOM order. Here's
an example where the sidebar moves above the main content when collapsing below the desktop
breakpoint:

<Canvas path="Layout/ColumnsResponsiveReverse" />

## Tiles

Sometimes you may need to control the number of columns but also allow wrapping, to create grid-like
layouts. This can't be achieved with `Inline` (becuase it doesn't control the number of columns),
nor `Columns` (because it does not allow wrapping).

In such cases, you can use the `Tiles` component, which lays out its children in a fixed number of
columns, wrapping if necessary:

<Canvas path="Layout/TilesThreeColumn" />

The `column` and `space` props can be set responsively, so you can adapt the layout based on the
active breakpoint. For example, here's how to render 4 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet and 1 on
mobile:

<Canvas path="Layout/TilesResponsive" />

## Inset

`Inset` is used to create a container with equal padding on each side:

<Canvas path="Layout/InsetAllAxis" />

Horizontal and vertical padding can be set independently using the `spaceX` and `spaceY` props:

<Canvas path="Layout/InsetHorizontalAndVertical" />

## ContentBlock

All components span the entire width of their container by default. In some cases, though, you may
want to cap their width: this is usually the case when working with page layouts or with long text
paragraphs.

In such cases, you can use `ContentBlock` to limit the `maxWidth` and optionally center the content
in the parent container.

For example, here's how to limit the width of long a paragraph of text to 700px, so that it stays
readable:

<Canvas path="Layout/ContentBlockAlignDefault" />

Another example is capping the maxWidth of the entire page content, and centering it:

<Canvas path="Layout/ContentBlockAlignCenter" />
